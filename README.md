# exoplanet-classification
This project implements machine learning models to classify exoplanet candidates using NASA’s Kepler mission dataset. Six classification algorithms — Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbor, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and XGBoost — are trained and evaluated on the same dataset.
